# mouse_mvt
A hotkey controlled mouse jiggler, with threading, written in Rust.

Designed to stop your computer sleeping when not being used.

Jiggles almost imperceptibly every two seconds.

Run in the terminal. Or can be compiled to .exe with cargo build --release.

Pressing NumberPad 4 starts the jiggler.

Pressing and holding NumberPad 5 pauses and runs in the background, ready to run again.

Pressing NumberPad 6 exits the program.
